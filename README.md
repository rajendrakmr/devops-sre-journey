Programming/Scripting
    Python, Go, or another automation-friendly language
    API usage (REST, gRPC)

2. Version Control & Collaboration

    Git basics (branches, merges, PRs, rebasing)
    GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket workflows
    GitOps concept (managing infra via Git)

Basics: init, clone, add, commit, push, pull
Branching & merging (git branch, git merge, git rebase)
Remote management (git remote, git fetch)
Undoing changes (reset, revert, stash)
Collaboration (fork, PR, issues)
Git workflows: Git Flow, trunk-based development
Git hooks (pre-commit, post-commit)

GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

Workflow basics (YAML structure, jobs, steps)
Triggers (push, pull_request, cron)
Using actions from the Marketplace
Matrix builds (run on multiple OS/languages)
Secrets & environment variables
Build automation (Docker build, npm/maven/pytest)
Testing (unit tests, integration tests in pipeline)
Deployments (to AWS, Kubernetes, Docker Hub, etc.)
Caching & artifacts for faster pipelines
_____________________________________________________________


3. CI/CD Pipelines 
    Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, ArgoCD
    Build automation (Maven, Gradle, npm, etc.)
    Testing in pipelines (unit, integration, security scans)
    Continuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment

4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

    Terraform â†’ infra provisioning
    Ansible / Chef / Puppet â†’ configuration management
    Packer â†’ golden images
    Learn modular, reusable infra patterns

Basics: Providers, resources, variables, outputs
State management (terraform state, backends, remote state)
Modules (reusable infrastructure code)
Provisioners & data sources
Workspaces (for multiple environments: dev, prod)
Terraform Cloud / Terraform Enterprise basics
Best practices:
DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) with modules
Version control Terraform code
Use terraform fmt, validate, plan, apply safely
Integrations: AWS (EC2, S3, VPC, IAM), GCP, Azure

    Networking (VPC, subnets, security groups)
    Managed services (RDS, Cloud SQL, etc.)
    Multi-cloud concepts
Core AWS Services
    Compute â†’ EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS
    Networking â†’ VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, Route 53
    Storage â†’ S3, EBS, EFS
